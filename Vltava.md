full programmatic structure 
melodic textural and timbrel features in the opening section of Vltava

a gradual increase in texture and complexity of chordal structure, representing the slow amalgamation of smaller streams forming the river itself. In the beginning there are two scalic melodies in two clarinets and two flutes, then another scalic melody comes in, followed by more smaller melodies that start to work together. 

resembles a polka

##### Theme and variations form
Theme and variations form typically consists of a wide variety of themes, which as the name suggests, contain variations from the original theme. These could include tonality variations, such as a modulation to the dominant to the relative minor, a change in textural make-up, such as bringing more accompaniment, or using more intense accompaniment or an instrumental change, as in bringing in more instruments, or changing the instrument(s) playing the main theme. They could also include melodic or rhythmic changes, such as . Throughout the a piece with this form, the different themes, while not directly repeated might be reused to a small degree, as well as or instead of an entirely new theme, unlike in rondo form.

##### Rondo form
Rondo form is an extension of the preexisting binary and ternary forms. There is a main theme (A) that alternates with different, contrasting themes, that create a juxtaposition in the music. They are labelled as the piece goes on, for example, A-B-A-C-A-D. It is not dissimilar to the form of themes and variations, as mentioned above, however theme 'A' returns each time, which does not occur in theme and variations.

Vltava is a particularly unique piece, in that while it could be described as following the theme and variations form, it could equally be argued to be following a style of rondo form. In terms of theme and variations, it consists of a wide variety of differing themes, that are each individual to one another. However, in terms of the rondo form, while it does contain all different themes, most are often strongly based off of theme 'A', with only very small changes.
