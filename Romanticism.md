Romantic music could be summarised as the use of expressive and emotive music.

Romanticism is a movement in the arts and literature that originated in the late eighteenth century emphasising inspiration subjectivity and primacy of the individual.

##### Technological changes
Industrial revolutions, particularly in metallurgy, meant that instrument makers could create stronger pianos, complex brass and woodwind instruments bristling with valves and keys, and a range of new percussion. Such developments provided a vastly expanded canvas and palette for the programmatic composer. It’s not surprising that Strauss chose to depict the dawn of time or the might of the Alps with such resources. Suddenly new expressive possibilities were opened up, stimulating the composer to: 
- Write for more extreme registers of their instruments, as these were now more stable and reliable. 
- Create more agile parts, as articulation and accuracy were improved. 
- Experiment with more dynamic and tonal range than before, from a whisper to a scream.

All of these made for an even more exciting musical story. Couple this with the improvement in the printing press and the conditions were perfect for writing more adventurous scores for larger forces. Also key was the speed with which ideas could now be communicated and parts could be distributed, thanks to faster modes of transport such as the train. This meant composers were more aware of the storytelling innovations of their counterparts, as well as having more ready access to literature and art for inspiration. Berlioz could easily pick up copies of Shakespeare to fuel his imagination, even though he couldn’t understand most of the English. If Tchaikovsky used harps and celestas, then other composers felt bound to follow suit.

##### Social changes
The American Revolution (1776), French Revolution (1789) and ensuing Napoleonic wars (up to 1815) instigated social change on a profound level. The bourgeoisie had a greater voice and there was a groundswell of resistance to oppression, with the middle class demanding democratic ideals. For the 19th-century composer, this meant:
- Stories of resistance and protest could now be conveyed in their music.
- ‘Rescue operas’ became popular (eg Beethoven’s Fidelio), where a hero battles for independence and freedom. 
- Historical characters and Shakespearean heroes (Coriolan through to Macbeth and Hamlet) were widely used and sometimes treated symbolically, to comment on present injustices. 
- More audience from the burgeoning middle class would attend the concerts, building numbers and support for new work.
There was also the introduction of the working class, which in turn created the middle class. this would go on to incite pianos in homes and  . Also, there is the development of trains, which allow for composers, musicians, and even ideas or supplies (in musical terms) being transported faster.

##### Influence of opera on concert music
The Baroque period, in particular, drew on the innovations of opera in depicting phenomena from nature, such as storms, sunrises and birdsong. There is much similarity in thinking between the Baroque and the Romantic periods, not least in the attraction to spectacle and theatricality. The instrumental forces and audiences may differ, but the same aim is shared of holding the listener enthralled to a captivating story. That said, it was the particular values and ideals of the Romantic period that allowed programmatic music to thrive.
opera was an outlet for expressive and creative music. it also induced the introduction of more technical changes, and in the case of Brahms and Schumann bringing in chamber qualities. 
Opera had a significant influence on concert music, particularly in the development of programmatic music. Composers began to use programmatic elements in their concert music, such as the use of leitmotifs to represent characters or ideas, and the use of descriptive titles to evoke imagery or tell a story. The use of programmatic elements in concert music was influenced by the storytelling and dramatic techniques used in opera, which aimed to engage and emotionally move the audience. Composers such as Berlioz and Liszt were particularly influenced by opera and used programmatic elements extensively in their concert works. Berlioz's "Symphonie fantastique" is a notable example of programmatic concert music that was influenced by his experiences attending opera performances.
