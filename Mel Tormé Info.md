Mel Tormé was a popular jazz singer from the 1940s to the 1990s, known for his husky voice. In his autobiography, he mentioned a wish that he had been born ten years earlier, so that he could have been a big-band singer like Frank Sinatra. Tormé was not only a singer, but also a skilled drummer, songwriter, arranger, actor, TV and radio host, and author of several books.

Mel Tormé was a renowned jazz singer from the 1940s to the 1990s, renowned for his distinctive husky voice. He wished he had been born earlier, so that he could have been a big-band singer like Frank Sinatra. Tormé was not only an impressive vocalist, but also a talented drummer, songwriter, arranger, actor, TV and radio host, and author.

At the age of 15, Mel Tormé won a competition at the Chicago World's Fair and began performing on radio dramas broadcast out of Chicago. He also continued singing and wrote his own songs. In 1940, he auditioned one of his original compositions, "Lament to Love" for Harry James, who initially invited him to join his band but later changed his mind due to Tormé's young age. The song was recorded for Columbia Records and became a hit, leading to a contact with Ben Pollack who was putting together a band for Chico Marx. Tormé joined at 16, as he was old enough to drop out of high school but too young for military service. Two airchecks of this band, recorded in December 1942, are the earliest recordings of him singing Irving Berlin's "Abraham" and playing a drum solo on "Pagliacci (Vesti la Giubba)". He eventually earned his diploma from Los Angeles High School in 1944 and served briefly in the army before being discharged.

Mel Tormé was a 17-year-old singer, songwriter, and actor who had a small role in the movie musical 'Higher and Higher' in 1943. He formed a vocal group with students from Los Angeles City College called the Schoolkids, which was later renamed Mel Tormé & His Mel-Tones. He released singles on Jewel Records, appeared on radio shows and in films, and had his own solo career. His songwriting partner Robert Wells wrote the much-loved Christmas classic "The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas to You)" with him, which has been covered over 1,700 times.

Mel Tormé's solo career was launched in 1947 when he began his first nightclub engagement at the Bocage in Los Angeles. This was followed by a movie contract with MGM, a 15-minute radio series on NBC, a songwriting assignment for the RKO film Magic Town, and a part in the Rodgers & Hart bio-pic Words and Music. He was also signed to Capitol Records, releasing several successful singles, including "Careless Hands" which reached number one. He subsequently wrote and recorded the ambitious musical work California Suite with the Mel-Tones and an orchestra conducted by Jud Conlon, which was released as his first LP in 1950. Tormé's film career, however, did not reach similar heights, with his role in The Duchess of Idaho trimmed to a few lines of dialogue and his one song left on the cutting-room floor.

Tormé scored his last chart entry for ten years with "Anywhere I Wander" in November 1952. It came from his final session for Capitol, after which he was without a label affiliation for a year before signing to the Coral subsidiary of Decca Records. Several singles sessions followed over the next year, and on December 15, 1954, Coral recorded a performance at the Crescendo Club in Los Angeles that resulted in the 1955 LP Gene Norman Presents Mel Tormé "Live" at the Crescendo, the first of many Tormé live albums. The singer moved to the small jazz label Bethlehem Records, starting with a ballad LP, [It's a Blue World](https://www.allmusic.com/album/its-a-blue-world-mw0000196852), recorded in August 1955. This was followed by the first of many recordings made in association with pianist/arranger [Marty Paich](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/marty-paich-mn0000858709), [Mel Tormé and the Marty Paich Dek-Tette](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-torm%C3%A9-and-the-marty-paich-dek-tette-mw0000188747), recorded in January 1956, and by a studio-cast recording of Porgy and Bess in which Tormé sang the part of Porgy to [Frances Faye](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/frances-faye-mn0000154664)'s Bess, recorded in May.

[![Sings Fred Astaire](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=EOesQF3MSxYShGtKwR-8R1WnbEN5fCjifro6xhIBuB4=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/sings-fred-astaire-mw0000122517 "Sings Fred Astaire")Tormé had begun to expand his touring territory overseas, appearing in Australia in the fall of 1955, and in the spring of 1956, the [Rodgers & Hart](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rodgers-hart-mn0000843194) song "Mountain Greenery," excerpted from the Coral live album, was released as a single in the U.K., reaching the Top Ten in July, in time for the singer's first visit to Europe. Back in Los Angeles in November, he cut the LP [Mel Tormé Sings Fred Astaire](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-torm%C3%A9-sings-fred-astaire-mw0000122517) with [Marty Paich](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/marty-paich-mn0000858709) and, on February 22, 1957, returned to the Crescendo Club for another live album, confusingly titled Gene Norman Presents Mel Tormé at the Crescendo. The following month, Bethlehem added to the confusion in the record racks by having Tormé recut California Suite. In its defense, the label was in trouble financially; after one more Tormé LP, [Songs for Any Taste](https://www.allmusic.com/album/songs-for-any-taste-mw0000003309) (actually consisting of leftover tracks from the Crescendo date), Bethlehem went out of business. Back in the U.K. in the summer of 1957, Tormé cut an album on Philips Records for his English fans, [Tormé Meets the British](https://www.allmusic.com/album/torm%C3%A9-meets-the-british-mw0001003689). In the U.S. in November, he contracted to the tiny Tops label for [Prelude to a Kiss](https://www.allmusic.com/album/prelude-to-a-kiss-mw0000250628), an album subsequently reissued over and over under various titles.

[![Back in Town](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=-0RISQcun1gqo_yyAGvumVWnbEN5fCjifro6xhIBuB4=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/back-in-town-mw0000272550 "Back in Town")On February 14, 1957, Tormé had taken a non-singing acting role in the television drama The Comedian, broadcast live on the prestigious Playhouse 90 series. The appearance reawakened his film career, and he made a series of appearances as a straight actor in usually low-budget films: The Fearmakers (1958), The Big Operator (1959), Girls Town (1959), Walk Like a Dragon (1960) (for which he wrote the title song), and The Private Lives of Adam and Eve (1961). His recording career picked up in 1958, when he was signed to impresario [Norman Granz](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/norman-granz-mn0000458778)'s jazz-oriented Verve Records, the same label on which such peers as [Ella Fitzgerald](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ella-fitzgerald-mn0000184502) recorded. The result was eight albums over the next four years: Tormé; Olé Tormé: Mel Tormé Goes South of the Border with Billy May; [Back in Town](https://www.allmusic.com/album/back-in-town-mw0000272550) (with [the Mel-Tones](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mel-tones-mn0000407305)); [Mel Tormé Swings Shubert Alley](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-torm%C3%A9-swings-shubert-alley-mw0000188828); [Swingin' on the Moon](https://www.allmusic.com/album/swingin-on-the-moon-mw0000124526); [Broadway, Right Now!](https://www.allmusic.com/album/broadway-right-now%21-mw0000914754) (with [Margaret Whiting](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/margaret-whiting-mn0000571845)); [I Dig the Duke! I Dig the Count!](https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-dig-the-duke%21-i-dig-the-count%21-mw0000890024); and [My Kind of Music](https://www.allmusic.com/album/my-kind-of-music-mw0000070304). The albums were well received, especially by the jazz community, without being big sellers. But by the early '60s, Verve was the subsidiary of a large record company, no longer an independent jazz label, and Tormé accepted an offer from what he thought would be the more sympathetic Ertegun brothers, [Ahmet](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ahmet-mn0000608054) and [Nesuhi](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nesuhi-mn0000325643), and their Atlantic Records label.

[![Mel Tormé at the Red Hill](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=__IGieq-ZNWkBQIqbbPypVWnbEN5fCjifro6xhIBuB4=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-torm%C3%A9-at-the-red-hill-mw0000876439 "Mel Tormé at the Red Hill")Unfortunately, Atlantic wanted Tormé to make more pop-oriented music. His initial effort for them, the live album [Mel Tormé at the Red Hill](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-torm%C3%A9-at-the-red-hill-mw0000876439), cut in March 1962, was what he had in mind, but Atlantic got what it wanted with the bluesy single "Comin' Home Baby," cut in September 1962, which gave Tormé a Top 40 hit on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and earned him his first two Grammy nominations (Best Solo Performance, Male, and Best Rhythm & Blues Recording), but which he did not care for. Atlantic rushed out a [Comin' Home Baby!](https://www.allmusic.com/album/comin-home-baby%21-mw0000769411) LP, but it did not chart.

In the spring of 1963, Tormé accepted an offer to serve as musical advisor for the upcoming television series The Judy Garland Show. He wrote arrangements and special material for the musical variety program, which broadcast 26 hour-long episodes beginning on Sunday night, September 29, 1963, and ending on March 29, 1964, when it was canceled. (He later recounted his experiences on the show in his first book, The Other Side of the Rainbow, published in 1970.) He took time out from the job in November 1963 to record the title song for the film Sunday in New York, which played under the credits when the picture was released the following month. Also in December he recorded an accompanying Atlantic LP, Mel Tormé Sings Sunday in New York & Other Songs About New York, marking the end of his association with the label.

[![That's All](https://cdn-s3.allmusic.com/release-covers/400/0001/904/0001904993.jpg)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/thats-all-mw0000311828 "That's All")Finished with The Judy Garland Show in the winter of 1964, Tormé returned to his main occupation, live performing. He signed to Columbia Records, for which he made a few singles during the year. And he took time out to play himself in the film The Patsy, released during the summer. He cut his first Columbia LP, [That's All](https://www.allmusic.com/album/thats-all-mw0000311828), in sessions conducted in December 1964 and March 1965. Unfortunately, he enjoyed his stay at Columbia even less than he had his time on Atlantic, especially as the label began pressuring him to record contemporary pop/rock songs. His 1966 sessions for the LP [Right Now!](https://www.allmusic.com/album/right-now%21-mw0000676712) included recent hits like "Homeward Bound," "Red Rubber Ball," and "Secret Agent Man," not his sort of thing at all. "Lover's Roulette" gave him a Top Ten hit on the Easy Listening chart in the summer of 1967, but it came from his next-to-last session for Columbia; by the end of the year he was off the label.

Tormé had appeared in another film, A Man Called Adam, in the summer of 1966, again playing himself, and cut the song "All That Jazz" (not to be confused with the song of the same title from the 1975 musical Chicago) for the soundtrack LP released on Reprise Records. He next began creating television roles for himself, writing an episode of the series Run for Your Life and guest-starring in it, then adapting Dollarhide, a Western novel he had written under a pseudonym in the '50s, into an episode of The Virginian and appearing on the show. He had, however, largely given up on his recordings, at least as a venue for work he liked, agreeing to record contracts as a necessary evil to help promote his live performances. Moving to Liberty Records in early 1968, he cut the LP A Day in the Life of Bonnie and Clyde, having composed the title song, the rest of the selections dating from the 1920s and '30s. In 1969, he was surprised to find himself back on Capitol Records, but dutifully cut what he called two "wonderfully forgettable" albums for the label, A Time for Us and [Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head](https://www.allmusic.com/album/raindrops-keep-fallin-on-my-head-mw0001330891). After this he disappeared from the record shelves for several years, while continuing to perform regularly.

[![Mel Torme At The Red Hill/Live At The Maisonette](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=t0Hk2OHMZPyVI6z56wz4mZhUoDg0hsvx4F4sL4oO-nA=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-torme-at-the-red-hill-live-at-the-maisonette-mw0000311975 "Mel Torme At The Red Hill/Live At The Maisonette")In May 1971, Tormé served as the host for an ABC documentary TV series, It Was a Very Good Year, each episode chronicling a year between 1919 and 1964. The series ran through the end of August. He returned to television in an acting role with his starring performance in the TV movie Snowman in 1974. He would continue to make occasional appearances in acting and singing roles on TV for the rest of his career. In September 1974, while appearing at the Maisonette Room in the St. Regis Hotel in New York with [Al Porcino & His Orchestra](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/al-porcino-his-orchestra-mn0001405286), Tormé recorded a live album that was picked up by Atlantic Records and released as [Live at the Maisonette](https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-maisonette-mw0000311975) in 1975. He claimed never to have seen any money from the LP, but it brought him his third Grammy nomination, not as a singer, but for Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for his "Gershwin Medley." In 1976, he finally signed a new record contract with Gryphon Records, recording the LP [Tormé! A New Album](https://www.allmusic.com/album/torm%C3%A9%21-a-new-album-mw0000064600) in London in June 1977. It was followed by the January 1978 sessions for [Together Again: For the First Time](https://www.allmusic.com/album/together-again-for-the-first-time-mw0000622321), on which he was co-billed with his longtime friend, drummer and bandleader [Buddy Rich](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/buddy-rich-mn0000539774), actually released prior to [Tormé! A New Album](https://www.allmusic.com/album/torm%C3%A9%21-a-new-album-mw0000064600). The [Rich](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rich-mn0000539774) LP earned Tormé his fourth Grammy nomination, in the Best Jazz Vocal Performance category in 1978 (the category had been created only two years earlier), while [Tormé! A New Album](https://www.allmusic.com/album/torm%C3%A9%21-a-new-album-mw0000064600) brought him his fifth in the same category in 1979. There was a sixth Grammy nomination, again for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, for his next LP, Mel Tormé and Friends Recorded Live at Marty's New York City, which was released on Finesse Records in 1981 and reached number 44 in the Billboard jazz chart. [Encore at Marty's](https://www.allmusic.com/album/encore-at-martys-mw0000178873) followed in 1982 on Flair Records.

[![Top Drawer](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=PoO0WxtjF5v0uH3wycQncJhUoDg0hsvx4F4sL4oO-nA=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/top-drawer-mw0000651566 "Top Drawer")By the early '80s, with traditional pop music beginning to come back into vogue, Tormé had weathered a long drought and was becoming appreciated as a jazz singer, performing regularly at jazz festivals, in prestigious concert halls, and with symphony orchestras, along with yearly engagements at top clubs in major cities around the world. In April 1982, he appeared with jazz pianist [George Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-shearing-mn0000642664) at the Peacock Court of the Hotel Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, their show recorded for the album An Evening with George Shearing & Mel Tormé, released by the jazz-oriented West Coast label Concord Records. Reaching number 34 in the jazz chart, it marked the beginning of felicitous and prolific associations with both [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664) and Concord. Tormé was nominated for his seventh Grammy, as usual for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, for 1982, and though he protested that [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664) deserved equal recognition, he won his first Grammy at the ceremony held in February 1983. The following month, he re-teamed with [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664) for the studio album [Top Drawer](https://www.allmusic.com/album/top-drawer-mw0000651566), the title track of which won him a second Grammy Award in February 1984. Another live album with [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664), [An Evening at Charlie's](https://www.allmusic.com/album/an-evening-at-charlies-mw0000188761), cut in Washington, D.C., in October 1983 and released in 1984, produced his ninth Grammy nomination, and another studio set with [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664), An Elegant Evening, recorded in May 1985, brought a tenth nomination for 1986.

[![A Vintage Year](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=u_CEr5GURjIHtBQeJuWif5hUoDg0hsvx4F4sL4oO-nA=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-vintage-year-mw0000652014 "A Vintage Year")In May 1986, Tormé interrupted his string of duet albums with [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664) but maintained his association with Concord, recording Mel Tormé with Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass; it hit number 11 in the jazz chart. The [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664) pairing was resumed in August 1987 with a session for the album [A Vintage Year](https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-vintage-year-mw0000652014). He renewed an older association in August 1988, cutting the LP [Reunion](https://www.allmusic.com/album/reunion-mw0000612050) with [Marty Paich](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/marty-paich-mn0000858709) and a reconstituted Dek-tette. The reunion continued in Japan in December, producing the 1989 album [In Concert Tokyo](https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-concert-tokyo-mw0000076461). Also in 1988, Tormé published his autobiography, It Wasn't All Velvet. A Tormé performance at the Concord Jazz Festival in August 1990 resulted in his next album, [Night at the Concord Pavilion](https://www.allmusic.com/album/night-at-the-concord-pavilion-mw0000311052), and the following month the singer and [Shearing](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shearing-mn0000642664) got back together in the studio for a collection of 1940s songs, [Mel and George "Do" World War II](https://www.allmusic.com/album/mel-and-george-do-world-war-ii-mw0000265339). Two months after that, he was captured live in Japan for the album Fujitsu-Concord Jazz Festival '90. He continued his busy recording schedule in March 1991, cutting a duet album with [Cleo Laine](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cleo-laine-mn0000120273), [Nothing Without You](https://www.allmusic.com/album/nothing-without-you-mw0000613826). The year also brought the publication of his long-promised biography of his friend [Buddy Rich](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/buddy-rich-mn0000539774), Traps, The Drum Wonder.

[![Christmas Songs](https://rovimusic.rovicorp.com/image.jpg?c=Jlufe25PuQeCAS4SLnmAHxyhM-OFI8zG4l-qVpXXB1I=&f=4)](https://www.allmusic.com/album/christmas-songs-mw0000091862 "Christmas Songs")In 1992, Tormé interrupted his run with Concord to cut a holiday collection, [Christmas Songs](https://www.allmusic.com/album/christmas-songs-mw0000091862), for Telarc Records. Amazingly, it brought him his first-ever chart placing in the listings for pop albums that December. Also for Telarc, he cut the live album [The Great American Songbook](https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-great-american-songbook-mw0000109885) in October 1992. But he returned to Concord only a month later for [Sing Sing Sing](https://www.allmusic.com/album/sing-sing-sing-mw0000095969), recorded with an all-star quintet back at the Fujitsu-Concord Jazz Festival in Tokyo. That made for enough recordings for a while, and he stuck to live performances until May 1994, when he cut the studio album [A Tribute to Bing Crosby](https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-tribute-to-bing-crosby-mw0000118972). A year later, he reunited with Rob McConnell and the Boss Brass for [Velvet & Brass](https://www.allmusic.com/album/velvet-brass-mw0000038992).

With Tormé's assistance, Rhino Records mounted the first comprehensive box set of his recordings, [The Mel Tormé Collection 1944-1985](https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mel-torm%C3%A9-collection-1944-1985-mw0000184432), in 1996, and in July he recorded the live album An Evening with Mel Tormé for the A&E network. The following month, on August 8, he suffered a stroke. While he had recovered sufficiently by November to be released from the hospital, he faced continuing medical challenges for the next three years and never returned to performing. In February 1999, Tormé was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He died at 73 on June 5, 1999.

While Tormé disavowed some of his recordings in his autobiography, particularly the ones made with pop intentions in the 1960s, his more jazz-styled sides seem to have met his high standards, as well as those of critics and fans. In truth, Tormé brought his considerable skills to any material he tackled, and his large body of recordings fully justifies the assessment of him as a major jazz singer of the post-World War II era.
