Mel Tormé's 1960 album "Swings Shubert Alley" was an important contribution to the 1960s swing style, as it helped to revitalize and popularize swing music during a time when jazz was starting to move towards more experimental and avant-garde styles.

One of the main ways in which Tormé's album contributed to the swing style of the 1960s was through its use of big band arrangements. Tormé's ensemble featured a full complement of brass and woodwind instruments, along with a rhythm section and backing vocals, creating a full, lush sound that was characteristic of swing music.

The album also showcased Tormé's exceptional vocal talents, including his virtuosic scat singing and ability to swing with the rhythm section. This helped to bring swing music to a new generation of listeners who were drawn to Tormé's dynamic and energetic performances.

In addition to its musical contributions, "Swings Shubert Alley" was also important for its cultural impact. The album helped to popularize swing music at a time when it was in danger of being overshadowed by other styles, and it helped to establish Tormé as a major figure in the jazz world.

Overall, Mel Tormé's "Swings Shubert Alley" was an important contribution to the 1960s swing style, both musically and culturally, and helped to ensure that swing music remained a vital part of the jazz tradition for years to come.
