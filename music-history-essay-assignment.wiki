Discuss changing approaches to the Programmatic Music during the period 1820-1910, and how these might relate to changes in musical culture.  

Remember:  
Changes in musical culture = 4 different paragraphs (changing audiences, changing working conditions, changing technologies, the Romantic Movement in the Arts) 
You use example works (earlier and later ones) to evidence these changes. Where can you see the influence of these changes in earlier and later works?
E.g. Where can you see the influence of these kinds of changes in Hebrides Overture? Where can you see the influence of these kinds of changes in the Dante Symphony?
