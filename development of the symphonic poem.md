# Development of the Symphonic Poem - improving the exemplar essay

The name symphonic poem was first used by the composer Liszt to describe a piece of music for orchestra in one
movement. This was a new type of programme music and the music was meant to illustrate a poem, story or painting
in detail rather than having the restraints of a structure such as sonata form. Composers in particular wanted their
listeners to imagine the programme rather than concentrating on the structure of the piece. Liszt aimed to expand
the one movement of the concert overture. The music in overtures, as a start to a play or opera was meant to inspire
listeners to imagine scenes or images, and this continued in the concert overture but Liszt wanted to write longer and
more complex works like the first movements of symphonies but without the rigid structure that was involved. He made
use of cyclic form and also thematic transformation in the symphonic poems he wrote. The first piece which he titled
symphonic poem was Les Preludes and he wrote several more including Hamlet, Mazeppa and Orpheus.

These are good examples of his use of cyclic forms and thematic transformation. The thematic transformation seen in Orpheus,
for example, follows along with the programme. Orpheus himself has a unique motif, that is warped throughout the piece.  
undergo. These also helps links themes together, to help give the piece a sense of continuity, and familiarity.

Many other composers wrote in the form including Strauss, who wrote Don Quixote and Ein Heldenleben.

The French composer Paul Dukas is famous today for a symphonic poem ‘The Sorcerer’s Apprentice’. He was particularly
admired for his orchestration and his careful use of instrumental sounds that can be seen in this work. He based this
symphonic poem on a poem by Goethe. The score, when published, was accompanied by a French translation of this
poem. It tells of a sorcerer’s apprentice who is left to clean up. When he tires of working he puts a spell onto a broom
to do the work for him. Unfortunately, there is soon far too much water and the apprentice cannot stop the broom. He
chops it in half, but this only creates two brooms. Fortunately, the sorcerer returns and sorts out the mess. Though this
work is subtitled a scherzo, it is only a scherzo in style (lively triple time), not in structure.

Other French composers continued to write symphonic poems such as Saint Saens with his piece also based on a poem
called Danse Macabre. The orchestration, and example of which might be his use of scordatura in the violin, sounds very 
colourful, and there is more of a use of non-tonal chords, augmented chords and tritones.

Debussy wrote a piece in impressionist style called ‘Après midi d’un faun. This again sets scenes
from a poem this time by Mallarmé where a sleeping faun dreams of nymphs.

During the second half of the 19th century some composers felt there was considerable German influence on music and
they aimed to do something different. They worked in national styles, reflecting their own countries in a variety of ways,
including folk music influences or using stories from a country’s history or legends. Many used the symphonic poem for
their music, including Smetana who wrote a series of six pieces called Ma Vlast (My Country) and Sibelius who is most
famous for his piece about his country called Finlandia.
