= Developments to the symphonic poem =
- Musical styles
  - Liszt
  - s-s & Dukas: Timbre and orchestration - scordatura, sounds very colourful, more use of non-tonal chords, augmented chords, tritones, Danse Macarbre: symphonic poem, Sorc App: Scherzo Elements
  - Leads onto Debussy: Impressionist style, timbre becomes a dominant musical element, colouristic harmony: where the relationship to the tonic is unclear, this means that the chord is percieved more like an instrumental timbre
    Parallel harmony, tonal ambiguity / moments of atonality, much more about personal sesation and personal experience - the inner emotional feelings and interpretations of the outside world
  - Impressionist music lacks clear tonal reference points. this means that it is less good at depicting very specific things, which also means that it is better at depitcting more abstract conceptual things, such as moods or experiecnces.
  - look up Mallarme's poem - Afternoon of a Faun
