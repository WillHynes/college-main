David rarely blinks
takes joy from students suffering
can survive a concert and still teach
refutes the existence of father Christmas to his children
Wars against Tim's opinion
Has 'Absolute' pitch, and let's us know
can't play in baroque pitch
Blinks 4/minutes
Judgemental
goes into standby mode at random intervals
overly fancy words
Selective memory
prioritises work over the students
works slightly faster than the students can keep up - form of torture
likes AO6 music
expects subservience from students
is extraordinarily rude about and to students about themselves
told me to "shut up" - 20/04/2023, 15:32
told Tally that her reputation precedes her, and that she was mean
called me a "tempter in his ear" 
passive aggressive all the time
called Tim bald - implied that he does not have hair in a roundabout way, maybe to try to avoid the blame
called us unique - we humans are alien to him
tries to get out of it by saying that every class is unique 
tries to spoil things (media)
he does not care about me :(
stalks around the class like a quiet Velociraptor
has a PhD
tries to beat up students by running into them
tries to make it better by saying he runs everywhere
sighs after lesson like it was exhausting - are we a pain to teach?
"oooooooooooooooohh dear"
disappointed that Heppy will be here
calls complete chaos "general banter"
"You've got **nothing** to laugh about"

"sixth form is a time when you're riadically finding yourselves"
stuck from the 1920s/1820s
prefers david over dave
doesn't like boringly repetetive music, especially longer pieces#
turned into tim and is now torturing us with chords, what the fuck is an 8 note chord
also, what the yellow painted jesus on a cross is a major *and* a minor chord
Who is frank bridge D':
has dramatic purpose, with atmospheric effect
is the emodyment of colouristic harmony
