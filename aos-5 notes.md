This passage discusses the character of Romanticism through quotes by Goethe, Schumann, and Schlegel. Goethe's quote reflects the view of Classical thinkers that Romanticism was a disease and excessive. Schumann's quote reminds us that Romanticism as a term was mainly applied after the event and did not have currency until much later in the 1800s. Schlegel's comment on Romantic poetry emphasises the fundamental aspect of freedom in the Romantic movement. The passage also discusses the obsessions and themes of Romanticism, including the freedom of expression and the exploration of human emotional experience.
Goethe thought Romanticism was sick, while Schumann noted that the term was applied after the event. Schlegel believed that Romantic poetry was all about freedom. Romantic themes include freedom of expression and exploration of human emotions. The movement allowed composers to question form and design, express their own ideals, respond to stories, express political ideals, and bypass censorship. Romantic themes first appeared in painting and literature before reaching their fullest expression in music.
In the context of Romanticism, Goethe's quote "What is classical I call healthy, what is Romantic, sick" reflects the belief of classical thinkers that Romanticism was a disease and a deviation from the rational, ordered world of the Enlightenment. Schumann's quote "I am sick and tired of the word 'Romantic', even though I have not spoken it ten times in my entire life" suggests that the term "Romantic" was applied retrospectively and did not have currency until much later in the 1800s. Schlegel's quote "Its overriding principle is that the poet's fantasy is subject to no agreed principles" summarises the Romantic movement's fundamental belief in freedom, including the freedom to question form and design, express political ideals, and bypass censorship. Romantic themes include love, unrequited passion, death, and redemption, which had been explored in music since the early common practice period. However, Romanticism allowed composers to treat these themes with greater intensity and urgency, as well as to express their own ideals and identities in their music.
Goethe and other Classical thinkers saw Romanticism as a disease that stretched music beyond its natural expressive bounds. However, Schumann reminds us that the term 'Romanticism' was applied after the event and not widely used until the 1800s. Romantic themes and styles had their predecessors in earlier periods such as Sturm und Drang and Empfindsamer. Romanticism was about freedom in music, and composers had the freedom to question form, express their own ideals, and reach a wider audience through newly built concert halls and salons.


The influence of folk music and nationalism in the Romantic period: Smetana's "[[Vltava|The Moldau]]" showcase the incorporation of folk melodies and nationalistic themes into classical music, for example there are links to particular places, such as a polka which could be reference to Czech.
