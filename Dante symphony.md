#### Tonal qualities, links to the theme
- minor key
- way to funky but supposed to be in d minor, finishes outside of it
- think like a violinist?
- starts tonally finishes, atonally - connected to hell, sounds wrong, disconcerting 
- three phrases, but still one theme 
- heavy use of chromatic scales
- resemblance of fear, and suffering
- loads of diminished 7ths
- rhythmic augmentation 

- thematic material 
- developmental?
- exposition
- recapitulation
- bridge?
- transition
---
second theme now

- diminished 7ths
- augmented chords
- rapidly passes through keys
- tonicisation
- E minor, F# Minor and G# Minor 
- briefly went to B Major

---
Purgatory

- very peaceful
- very nice, which is weird.
