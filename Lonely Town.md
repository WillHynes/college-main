### Where
- the texture in the introduction is particularly thin, with only the lead singer and accompanying piano 
- in the first verse, it is still a minimal texture largely with the voice, but then other instruments join in to create a slightly thicker and more complex texture, but only in quantity, due to the instruments playing simplistic melodies. 

### Flavours
- the piano introduction sounds improvised, and as though it is working with the main vocals, instead of being predefined accompaniment 
- loads of 5ths and 4ths instead of the normal 3rds in jazz
- starts in F chromatic chord changes in the start
- doesn't sound definite, major chords bu that are not as easy to tell which key its from
- chord comes across as a complex chord than it actually is
- some do have a definite feel to them
- can not distinguish between major and minor. 

### What and how
- the rhythm is notably slow, and with a soft, simplistic drum beat. despite it's speed, there is little freedom with the time. 
- the instruments are all playing quite gentle notes and are all playing similar melodies. 
- the melody itself

# Analysis

In the introduction of Sinatra's version, the texture is similar, being notably thin, with only one instrument. It also has the same intervals. however, the main notable difference is that it is a horn instead of a piano or vocals. They both contribute to the theme of loneliness.
